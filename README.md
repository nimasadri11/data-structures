# data-structures-and-algorithms

Welcome to this repo!
Here I will be implementing data structures and algorithms from scratch. I will code in both functional and imperative paradigms. For the most part I will be using Racket (which is based on Scheme and LISP) for the functional part, and C for the imperative programs. I may use python occasionally, but I will try to avoid that due to its limitations.
Feel free to suggest any algorithms and/or data structures for me to implement.
